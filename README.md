Welcome to your new **Nx monorepo**! This repository houses the InfinityElectronics frontend apps, libraries, and tooling for a streamlined, scalable workflow.

## Getting Started

1. **Install pnpm (if you haven‚Äôt yet)**  
   We recommend using `pnpm` for faster, more consistent dependency installation.  
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
   Or visit the [pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io/installation) for alternative install methods.

2. **Install dependencies**  
   In the root of your repository, run:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   This will install all required packages for every project in this Nx workspace.

3. **Explore the workspace**  
   Check out the Nx docs specific to [Nuxt integrations](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nuxt?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects), or run:
   ```bash
   pnpx nx graph
   ```
   This visually explores the structure and dependencies of your projects.

## Running Your App

To start a local dev server for your main SPA (Nuxt 3) app:

```bash
pnpx nx serve spa
```

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpx nx build spa
```

## Other Project Tasks

List all available targets for the `spa` project:

```bash
pnpx nx show project spa
```

These tasks (build, serve, test, etc.) are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined within `project.json` / `package.json`.

## Adding New Projects

You can add more applications or libraries using Nx generators. For example:

```bash
pnpx nx g @nx/nuxt:app demo
```
Creates a new Nuxt-based app named `demo`.

```bash
pnpx nx g @nx/vue:lib mylib
```
Generates a Vue library named `mylib`.

Use `pnpx nx list` to see all installed plugins, and `pnpx nx list <plugin-name>` for more details about a specific plugin. Alternatively, install [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to explore generators within your IDE.
